# Jekyll-Gulp

Jekyll is amazing, but as it can be pretty limiting with assets like Sass and Javascript. This build process uses Gulp for these and other potential assets, so fun things like Autoprefixer, UnCSS, and others.


## Setup Instructions

1. Install npm dependencies `npm install`
2. Install bower dependencies `bower install`
3. Install gem dependencies `bundle install`
4. Start serving `gulp`
